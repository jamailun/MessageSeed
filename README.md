# MessageSeed

## Context

Real world interactive systems class, from Keio University, Fall 2022.

This project also use the (server repository)[https://github.com/JackyL56/MessageSeed_Django].

## Concept

**MessageSeed** is an application allowing users to post messages to their current position. Anyone can then see a message around them, and water messages they like. A message is a plant, and can wither with time or thrives if watered enough. When it's the case, the seed can evolve to a bush, then a tree.
